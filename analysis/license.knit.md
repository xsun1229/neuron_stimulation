  This reproducible <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>
  analysis was created with <a
  href="https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr">workflowr</a> (version
  1.7.0). The <em>Checks</em> tab describes the
  reproducibility checks that were applied when the results were created.
  The <em>Past versions</em> tab lists the development history.

Great! Since the R Markdown file has been committed to the Git repository, you
know the exact version of the code that produced these results.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and
connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version 6f6f62d.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the
R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the
analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can
use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only
checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data
files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the
results were generated:
</p>

<pre><code>
Unstaged changes:
	Modified:   analysis/index.Rmd

</code></pre>

<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in
this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted
changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made
to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/license.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/license.html</code>)
files. If you've configured a remote Git repository (see
<code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to
view the files as they were in that past version.
