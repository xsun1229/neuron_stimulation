Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Based on the candidate genes from cTWAS &amp;&amp; neuron-stimulation
eQTL data. We did enrichment analyses to see if the candidate genes are
enriched in SCZ-related gene lists or SCZ-related benchmark genes.</p>
<p>The overall enrichment analysis pipeline is:</p>

<li><p>Selecting the candidate genes: we filtered the genes using PIP

<li><p>Baseline genes: all genes analyzed in ctwas but not candidate
genes are considered as baseline genes.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing the overlap for candidate genes &amp; gene sets and
baseline genes &amp; gene sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Fisher tests</p></li>

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
